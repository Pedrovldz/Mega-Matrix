This code allows the user to input numbers to make a matrix.
Then, it shows the sum of all the odd numbers. If it does not have any odd number, it shows that the user didnt input any odd number.
then, it show the greatest value of the 3rd collum and the greatest value of the 2nd line

Last of all, it converts all the numbers to its respective number. EX:  1 = !; 2 = @; 3 = #

Its my first original code. If you have any tips, i would aprecciate that!
